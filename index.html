  <h1>Hi, I'm Aarav Pillai!</h1>
  <p>

I work on creative AI, with a particular interest in how generative systems are designed, governed, and quietly permitted to make decisions about culture and people. I am less taken with technological spectacle than with the practical afterlife of these systems; what they assume, what they normalise, and how policy language behaves once it encounters deployed code.

My research brings together technical work on generative models with human-centred and policy-facing analysis. I look at how concepts such as creativity, fairness, and inclusion are translated into systems that claim neutrality, and at the predictable points where those translations begin to fray. I am especially interested in the small but consequential distance between institutional intent and technical reality.

I currently lead research at Qinārā AI Lab, and have previously worked as an associate lecturer at the UAL Creative Computing Institute, alongside training and practice as a data scientist. I am preparing for doctoral research in HCI, focusing on creative AI and technology governance.
