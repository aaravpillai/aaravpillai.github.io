  <h1>Hi, I'm Aarav Pillai!</h1>
  <p>

I work on creative AI, with a particular interest in how generative systems are designed, governed, and quietly permitted to make decisions about culture and people. I am less taken with technological spectacle than with the practical afterlife of these systems; what they assume, what they normalise, and how policy language behaves once it encounters deployed code.   

  </p>
  <p>
I currently lead research at Qinārā AI Lab, and have previously worked as an associate lecturer at the UAL Creative Computing Institute, alongside working as an independant data scientist. I am also preparing for doctoral research in HCI, focused on creative AI and technology governance.

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AI policy, especially where rules meet reality</li>
    <li>Healthcare AI and its bureaucratic afterlives</li>
    <li>Creative generative models and their cultural blind spots</li>
    <li>Accessibility and neurodiversity, by design rather than accommodation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>MSc Thesis</h2>

  <p style="font-style: italic; color:#4f6a5e;">
    thesis focus: timbre transfer, autistic stimming, and assistive sound design
  </p>
<p>
    My master’s thesis examined how timbre-transfer models might be repurposed not for musical novelty, but for self-regulation; specifically to support autistic stimming practices rather than suppress them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project sits at the intersection of Creative AI, accessibility, and care; it treats sound not as output, but as infrastructure.
